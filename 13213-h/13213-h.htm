    <p>Bertie was a very good boy. He was kind, obedient, truthful,
    and unselfish. He had, however, one great fault,&mdash;he
    always forgot.</p>

    <p>No matter how important the errand, his answer always was,
    "I forgot." When he was sent with a note to the dress-maker his
    mother would find the note in his pocket at night. If he was
    sent to the store in a great hurry, to get something for tea,
    he would return late, without the article, but with his usual
    answer.</p>

    <p>His father and mother talked the matter over, and decided
    that something must be done to make the little boy
    remember.</p>

    <p>Christmas was near, and Bertie was busy making out a list of
    things which Santa Claus was to bring him.</p>

    <p>"Santa Claus may forget some of those things," said his
    mother.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/025.jpg"

             alt="CHRISTMAS FROLICS" /></a>CHRISTMAS FROLICS
    </div>

    <p>"He cannot," replied Bertie; "for I shall write sled, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
    <br />
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> skates, and drum, and violin,
       and all the things on this paper. Then when Santa Claus goes
       to my stocking he will find the list. He can see it and put
       the things in as fast as he reads."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/026.jpg"

             src="images/026.jpg"
             alt="Bertie" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Christmas morning came, and Bertie was up at dawn to see
    what was in his stocking. His mother kept away from him as long
    as she could, for she knew what Santa Claus had done.</p>

    <p>Finally she heard him coming with slow steps to her room.
    Slowly he opened the door and came towards her. He held in his
    hand a list very much longer than the one he had made out. He
    put it in his mother's hand, while tears of disappointment fell
    from his eyes.</p>

    <p>"See what Santa Claus left for me; but I think he might have
    given me one thing besides."</p>

    <p>His mother opened the roll. It was a list of all the errands
    Bertie had been asked to do for six months. At the end of all
    was written, in staring capitals, "I FORGOT."</p>

    <p>Bertie wept for an hour. Then his mother told him they were
    all going to grandpa's. For the first time he would see a
    Christmas-tree. Perhaps something might be growing there for
    him.</p>

    <p>It was very strange to Bertie, but on grandpa's tree he
    found everything he had written on his list. Was he cured of
    his bad habit? Not all at once; but when his mother saw that he
    was particularly heedless she would say, "Remember, Santa Claus
    does not forget."</p>

    <h2><a name="p23"
       id="p23">THE FAIRY CHRISTMAS.</a></h2>

    <p>It was Christmas Day, and Toddy and Tita were alone. Papa
    and mamma had gone out West to see their big boy who was ill.
    They had promised to be home for Christmas, but a big snow had
    blocked the railroad track, and nurse was afraid the train
    would be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> delayed until the day after
       Christmas. What a dull Christmas for two little girls, all
       alone in the great city house, with only the servants! They
       felt so lonely that nurse let them play in the big
       drawing-room instead of in the nursery, so they arranged all
       the chairs in a row, and pretended it was a snowed-up train.
       Tita was the conductor, and Toddy was the passengers. Just
       as they were in the midst of it, they heard music in the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> street, and, running to the
       window, they saw a little boy outside, singing and beating a
       tambourine.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/028.jpg"

             id="fig028"><img width="100%"
             src="images/028.jpg"
             alt="barefoot Guido" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Why," said Tita, "his feet are all bare!"</p>

    <p>"Dess he hanged up bofe stockin's an' his shoes, too," said
    Toddy.</p>

    <p>"Let's open the window and ask him."</p>

    <p>But the great window was too high to reach, so they took
    papa's cane and pushed it tip. The little boy smiled, but they
    could not hear what he said, so they told him to come in, and
    ran to open the big front door. He was a little frightened at
    first, but the carpet felt warm to his poor bare feet.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:75%;">
        <a href="images/029.jpg"

             src="images/029.jpg"
             alt="Guido, Toddy and Tita" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>He told them that his name was Guido, and that he had come
    from Italy, which is a much warmer country than ours, and that
    he was very poor, so poor that he had no shoes, and had to go
    singing from house to house for a few pennies to get some
    dinner. And he was <i>so</i>
    hungry.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>

    <p>"Poor little boy!" said Tita. "Our mamma is away, and we're
    having a pretty sad Christmas, but we'll try to make it nice
    for <i>you.</i>"</p>

    <p>So they played games, and Guido sang to them. Then the
    folding doors rolled back, and there was the dining-room and
    the table all set, and Thomas, the black waiter, smiling, just
    as if it had been a big dinner party instead of two very little
    girls. Nurse said: "Well, I never!" when she saw Guido, but she
    felt so sorry for the lonely little girls that she let him come
    to the table. And <i>such</i> a dinner as he ate! He had never
    had one like it before. "It is a fairy tale," he said.</p>

    <p>Just as dessert came on, the door opened and in rushed mamma
    and papa; the train had gotten in, after all. They were so glad
    to see their darlings happy instead of moping that they gave
    them each some extra kisses. You may be sure little Guido never
    went hungry and barefoot after that. Long afterward he would
    say: "That was a fairy Christmas!"</p>

    <p>That night, after Tita had said her prayers, she said:</p>

    <p>"Mamma, I know something. Whenever you feel sad and lonely,
    if you will just find somebody sadder and lonelier than
    yourself and cheer them up, it will make you all right."</p>

    <p>And I think that that was the very best kind of a Christmas
    lesson of love. Don't you?</p>

    <h2><a name="p27"
       id="p27">CHRISTMAS DAY.</a></h2>

    <p>"Boys," said Mrs. Howard one morning, looking up from a
    letter she was reading, "I have had a letter from your
    grandmamma. She writes that she is returning to England
    shortly."</p>

    <p>The boys went on with their breakfast without showing any
    great amount of interest in this piece of news, for they had
    never seen their grandmother, and therefore could not very well
    be expected to show any affection for her.</p>

    <p>Now Mrs. Howard, the mother of two of the boys and aunt to
    the third little fellow, was a widow and very poor, and often
    found it a hard task to provide for her "three boys," as she
    called them, for, having adopted her little orphan nephew, she
    always treated him as her own son. She had sometimes thought it
    strange that old Mrs. Howard should not have offered to provide
    for Leslie herself but she had never done so, and at last Mrs.
    Howard had ceased to expect it. But now, right at the end of
    her letter, Grandmamma Howard wrote:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I have been thinking that perhaps it would come a little
    hard on you to support not only your own two boys, but poor
    Alice's son, and so, on my return to England, I propose, if you
    are willing, to adopt one of them, for I am a lonely old woman
    and shall be glad of a young face about me again."</p>

    <p>After thinking the matter over, Mrs. Howard decided she
    would say nothing about their grandmother's intention to the
    boys, as she thought that it was just possible she might change
    her mind again.</p>

    <p>Time passed on, and winter set in, and full of the delights
    of skating, the boys forgot all about the expected arrival of
    their grandmother.</p>

    <p>During the Christmas holidays the boys one morning started
    off to Broome Meadow for a good day's skating on the pond
    there. They carried their dinner with them, and were told to be
    sure and be home before dark.</p>

    <p>As they ran along the frosty road they came suddenly upon a
    poor old woman, so suddenly that Leslie ran right up against
    her before he could stop himself. The old woman grumbled about
    "lazy, selfish <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span> boys, only thinking of their
       own pleasure, and not caring what happened to a poor old
       woman!"</p>

    <p>But Leslie stopped at once and apologized, in his polite
    little way, for his carelessness.</p>

    <p>"I <i>am</i> sorry," he said. "I hope I did not hurt you;
    and you have such heavy parcels to carry too. Won't you let me
    help you?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! come on, Leslie," said his cousins; "we shall never get
    to the pond at this rate!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, go on," said the old woman sharply; "your skating is
    of a great deal more importance than an old woman, eh?"</p>

    <p>But Leslie's only answer was to take the parcels and trudge
    merrily along beside his companion.</p>

    <p>On the way to her cottage the old woman asked him all sorts
    of questions about himself and his cousins, and then, having
    reached her cottage, dismissed him with scarcely a "thank you"
    for the trouble he had taken. But Leslie did not take it much
    to heart.</p>

    <p>He raced along, trying his hardest to overtake his cousins
    before they reached the pond, and was soon skimming about with
    the rest of them.</p>

    <p>Squire Leaholme, in whose grounds the boys were skating,
    afterwards came down to the pond to watch the fun, and, being a
    kind-hearted old gentleman, offered to give a prize of a new
    pair of skates to the boy who should win the greatest number of
    races.</p>

    <p>As it was getting late, it was arranged that the racing
    should come off on the following day, and the Squire invited
    all the boys who took part in it, to come up to his house to a
    substantial tea, after the fun was over.</p>

    <p>How delighted Leslie was, for he was a first-rate skater,
    and he <i>did</i> so want a new pair of skates!</p>

    <p>But the Squire's skates were not to be won by him, for on
    the following day as he and his cousins were on their way to
    the pond, they came across the queer old woman whom they had
    met on the previous day.</p>

    <p>She was sitting on the ground, and seemed to be in great
    pain. The boys stopped to ask what ailed her, and she told them
    that she had slipped and twisted her foot, and was afraid that
    her ankle was sprained, for she could not bear to put it to the
    ground.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"

    <p>"You musn't sit here in the cold," said Leslie; "come, try
    and get up, and I will help you home."</p>

    <p>"Oh! Leslie," cried both his cousins, "don't go. You will be
    late for the races, and lose your chance of the prize."</p>

    <p>Poor Leslie! He turned first red, then white, and then said,
    in a husky tone of voice&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Never mind&mdash;you go on without me."</p>

    <p>"You're a good laddie," said the old woman. "Will you be
    <i>very</i> sorry to miss the fun?"</p>

    <p>Leslie muttered something about not minding <i>much</i>, and
    then the brave little fellow set himself to help the poor old
    woman home, as gently and tenderly as he could.</p>

    <p>She would not let him come in with her, but told him to run
    off as quickly as he could, and perhaps after all, he would not
    be too late for the skating. But Leslie could not bear to leave
    her alone and in pain, so he decided to run home and fetch his
    Aunt.</p>

    <p>When Mrs. Howard arrived at the cottage, you can think how
    surprised she was to find that Leslie's "poor old woman" was
    none other than Grandmamma Howard herself, who wishing to find
    out the real characters of her grandsons, had chosen to come in
    this disguise to the little village where they lived.</p>

    <p>You will easily guess which of the three boys Grandmamma
    chose to be her little companion. And oh! what a lovely
    Grandmamma she was, as not only Leslie, but his cousins too,
    found out. She always seemed to know exactly what a boy wanted,
    and still better, to give it to him.</p>

    <p>Walter and Stanley often felt terribly ashamed of the
    selfish manner in which they had behaved, and wished they were
    more like Leslie.</p>

    <p>But Grandmamma told them that it was "never too late to
    mend," and they took her advice, and I am quite sure that at
    the present moment if they were to meet a poor old woman in
    distress by the roadside, they would not pass her by, as they
    once did Grandmamma Howard.</p>

    <p>It was the week before Christmas, and the dolls In the
    toy-shop played together all night. The biggest one was from
    Paris.</p>

    <p>One night she said, "We ought to have a party before Santa
    Claus carries us away to the little girls. I can dance, and I
    will show you how."</p>

    <p>"I can dance myself if you will pull the string," said a
    "Jim Crow" doll.</p>

    <p>"What shall we have for supper?" piped a little boy-doll in
    a Jersey suit. He was always thinking about eating.</p>

    <p>"Oh, dear," cried the French lady, "I don't know what we
    shall do for supper!"</p>

    <p>"I can get the supper," added a big rag doll. The other
    dolls had never liked her very well, but they thanked her now.
    She had taken lessons at a cooking-school, and knew how to make
    cake and candy. She gave French names to everything she made,
    and this made it taste better. Old Mother Hubbard was there,
    and she said the rag doll did not know how to cook
    anything.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/036-2.jpg"

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>

    <p>They danced in one of the great shop-windows. They opened a
    toy piano, and a singing-doll played "Comin' through the Rye,"
    The dolls did not find that a good tune to dance by; but the
    lady did not know any other, although she was the most costly
    doll in the shop. Then they wound up a music-box, and danced by
    that. This did very well for some tunes; but they had to walk
    around when it played "Hail Columbia," and wait for something
    else.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/037.jpg"

             alt="dolls flying" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The "Jim Crow" doll had to dance by himself, for he could do
    nothing but a "break-down." He would not dance at all unless
    some one pulled his string. A toy monkey did this; but he would
    not stop when the dancer was tired.</p>

    <p>They had supper on one of the counters. The rag doll placed
    some boxes for tables. The supper was of candy, for there was
    nothing in the shop to eat but sugar hearts and eggs. The dolls
    like candy better than anything else, and the supper was
    splendid. Patsy McQuirk said he could not eat candy. He wanted
    to know what kind of a supper it was without any potatoes. He
    got very angry, put his hands into his pockets, and smoked his
    pipe. It was very uncivil for him to do so in company. The
    smoke made the little ladies sick, and they all tried to climb
    into a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> "horn of plenty" to get out
       of the way.</p>

    <p>Mother Hubbard and the two black waiters tried to sing "I
    love Little Pussy;" but the tall one in a brigand hat opened
    his mouth wide, that the small dollies were afraid they might
    fall into it. The clown raised both arms in wonder, and Jack in
    the Box sprang up as high as me could to look down into the
    fellow's throat.</p>

    <p>All the baby-dolls in caps and long dresses had been put to
    bed. They woke up when the others were at supper, and began to
    cry. The big doll brought them some candy, and that kept them
    quiet for some time.</p>

    <p>The next morning a little girl found the toy piano open. She
    was sure the dolls had been playing on it. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"

    <h2><a name="p35"
       id="p35">GRANDMA'S CHRISTMAS GIFTS.</a></h2>

    <p>Grandma Burns sat knitting busily in the sun one bright
    morning the week before Christmas. The snow lay deep, and the
    hard crust glistened like silver. All at once she heard little
    sighs of grief outside her door. When she opened it there sat
    Peter and Jimmy Rice, two very poor little boys, with their
    faces in their hands; and they were crying.</p>

    <p>"My patience!" cried grandma. "What can be the matter with
    two bright little boys this sunny morning?"</p>

    <p>"We don't have no good times," sighed little Peter.</p>

    <p>"We can't slide. We haven't any sleds," whimpered Jimmy.</p>

    <p>"Why, of course boys can't have a good time without sleds,"
    said grandma, cheerily. "Let us look about and see if we can't
    find something." And grandma's cap-border bobbed behind barrels
    and boxes in the shed and all among the cobwebs in the garret;
    but nothing could be found suitable.</p>

    <p>"Hum! I do believe this would do for little Pete;" and the
    dear old lady drew a large, pressed-tin pan off the top shelf
    in the pantry. A long, smooth butter-tray was found for Jimmy.
    Grandma shook her cap-border with laughter to see them skim
    over the hard crust <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> in their queer sleds. And the
       boys shouted and swung their hands as they flew past the
       window.</p>

    <p>"I do expect they'll wear 'em about through," murmured
    grandma; "but boys must slide,&mdash;that's certain."</p>

    <p>And the pan was scoured as bright as a new silver dollar and
    the red paint was all gone off the wooden tray when Peter and
    Jimmy brought their sleds back.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

    <p>Grandma knitted faster than ever all that day, and her face
    was bright with smiles. She was planning something. She went to
    see Job Easter that night. He promised to make two small sleds
    for the pair of socks she was knitting.</p>

    <p>When the sleds were finished she dyed them red and drew a
    yellow horse upon each one. Grandma called them horses, but no
    one would have suspected it. Then the night before Christmas
    she drew on her great socks over her shoes to keep her from
    slipping, put on her hood and cloak, and dragged the little
    sleds over to Peter and Timmy's house.</p>

    <p>She hitched them to the door-latch, and went home laughing
    all the way.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"

    <p>It had seemed to the little Wendell children that they would
    have a very sad Christmas. Mama had been very ill, and papa had
    been so anxious about mama that he could not think of anything
    else.</p>

    <p>When Christmas Day came, however, mama was so much better
    that she could lie on the lounge. The children all brought
    their stockings into her room to open them.</p>

    <p>"You children all seem as happy as if you had had your usual
    Christmas tree," said mama, as they sat around her.</p>

    <p>"Why, I <i>never</i> had such a happy Christmas before,"
    said sweet little Agnes. "And it's just because you are well
    again."</p>

    <p>"Now I think you must all run out for the rest of the day,"
    said the nurse, "because your mama wants to see you all again
    this evening."</p>

    <p>"I wish we could get up something expressly for mama's
    amusement," said Agnes, when they had gone into the
    nursery.</p>

    <p>"How would you like to have some tableaux in here?" asked
    their French governess, Miss Marcelle.</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes," they all cried, "it would be fun, mama loves
    tableaux."</p>

    <p>So all day long they were busy arranging five tableaux for
    the evening. The tableaux were to be in the room which had
    folding-doors opening into Mrs. Wendell's sitting-room.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

    <p>At the proper time Miss Marcelle stepped outside the
    folding-doors and made a pretty little speech. She said that
    some young ladies and a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>
    <br />
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> young gentleman had asked
       permission to show some tableaux to Mrs. Wendell if she
       would like to see them. Mrs. Wendell replied that she would
       be charmed.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

             alt="sleeping beauty" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Then mademoiselle announced the tableaux; opening the doors
    wide for each one. This is a list of the tableaux: First, The
    Sleeping <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> Beauty; second, Little Red
       Riding Hood; third, The Fairy Queen; fourth, Old Mother
       Hubbard; fifth, The Lord High Admiral.</p>

    <p>Miss Marcelle had arranged everything so nicely, and
    Celeste, the French maid, helped so much with the dressing,
    that the pictures all went off without a single mistake.</p>

    <p>Mama was delighted. She said she must kiss those dear young
    ladies, and that delightful young man who had given her such a
    charming surprise.</p>

    <p>So all the children came in rosy and smiling.</p>

    <p>"Why, didn't you know us?" asked the little Lord
    Admiral.</p>

    <p>"I know this," said mama, "I am like Agnes; I <i>never</i>
    had such a happy Christmas before."</p>

    <h2><a name="p42"
       id="p42">THE CHRISTMAS CAROL OF THE BIRDS.</a></h2>

    <p>Do you know, when we are having such good times at
    Christmas, what sweet music they have in Norway, that cold
    country across the sea? One day in the year the simple peasants
    who live there make the birds very happy, so that they sing, of
    their own free-will, a glad, joyous carol on Christmas
    morning.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:75%;">
        <a href="images/046.jpg"

             src="images/046.jpg"
             alt="watching the birds" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>And this is why they sing on that morning more than on any
    other. After the birds have found shelter from the north wind
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> on Christmas-eve, and the
       night is still and bright with stars, or even if the storm
       be ever so severe, the good people bring out sheaves of corn
       and wheat from their storehouses. Tying them on slender
       poles, they raise them from every spire, barn, gatepost, and
       gable; then, when the Christmas sun rises over the hills,
       every spire and gable bursts forth into joyous song.</p>

    <p>You can well believe that these songs of the birds make the
    people of Norway very happy. They echo, with all their hearts,
    their living, grateful anthem, "Glory to God in the highest, on
    earth peace, good-will to men!"</p>

    sometime give me?"</p>

    <p>"No," replied her papa, reading on. "Your uncle says it is a
    turkey for one."</p>

    <p>"But we do not need turkeys from Japan," remarked the little
    daughter, soberly.</p>

    <p>Her papa smiled, and handed the open letter to her mamma.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> "Read it aloud, every bit,"
       begged Lura, seeing her mamma was smiling, too.</p>

    <p>But her mamma folded the letter and said nothing.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">

    <p>On Christmas eve the box, which had just arrived, was
    opened, and every one in the house was made glad with a
    present. Lura's was a papier-mache turkey, nearly as large as
    the one brought home at the same time by the market-boy.</p>

    <p>Next morning, while the fowl in the kitchen was being
    roasted, Lura placed hers before a window and watched people
    admire it as they passed. All its imitation feathers, and even
    more its red wattles, seemed to wish every man and woman, boy
    and girl, a Merry Christmas.</p>

    <p>Lura had not spoken of the jewelry since her uncle's letter
    was read. It is not nice for one who receives a gift to wish it
    was different. Lura was not that kind of a child.</p>

    <p>When dinner was nearly over, her papa said to her, "My dear,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> you have had as much of my
       turkey as you wanted; if you please, I will now try some of
       yours."</p>

    <p>"Mine is what Uncle Roy calls a turkey for one," laughed
    Lura. She turned in her chair towards where her bird had been
    strutting on the window-sill, and added, in surprise, "Why,
    what has become of him?"</p>

    <p>At that moment the servant brought in a huge platter. When
    room had been made for it on the table it was set down in front
    of Lura's papa, and on the dish was her turkey.</p>

             alt="turkey on platter" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Oh, what fun!" gayly exclaimed the child. "Did uncle tell
    you to pretend to serve it?"</p>

    <p>"I have not finished what he directs me to do," her papa
    said, with a flourish of the carving-knife.</p>

    <p>"But, papa&mdash;oh, please!" Her hand was on his arm. "You
    would not spoil my beautiful bird from Japan!</p>

    <p>A hidden spring was touched with the point of the knife. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> breast opened, and disclosed
       the fowl filled with choice toys and other things. The first
       taken out was a tiny box; inside was a gold chain and
       locket; the locket held Uncle Roy's picture.</p>

    <p>It was a turkey for one,&mdash;for only Uncle Roy's niece.
    But all the family shared the amusement.</p>

    <p>t was Christmas Eve and the frost fairies were busy getting
    ready for Christmas Day. First of all they spread the loveliest
    white snow carpet over the rough, bare ground; then they hung
    the bushes and trees with icicles that flashed like diamonds in
    the moonlight. Later on, they planned to draw beautiful frost
    pictures on the window panes, to surprise the little children
    in the morning.</p>

    <p>The stars shone brightly and the moon sent floods of light
    in every nook and corner. How could any one think of sleeping
    when there was such a glory outside!</p>

    <p>Jessie and Fred had gone to bed very early so they might be
    the first to shout "Merry Christmas!" but their eyes would not
    stay shut.</p>

    <p>"Oh dear! it must be 'most morning," said Fred; "let us
    creep softly down stairs and maybe we'll catch Santa Claus
    before he rides off."</p>

    <p>Hand in hand they tiptoed to the dining-room and peeped out
    the big window;&mdash;surely, surely, that was something
    climbing up the roof of cousin Nellie's house; it must be old
    Santa. Fred gave a chuckle of delight; to be sure the reindeer
    were very queer looking objects, and the sleigh such a funny
    shape, but the children were satisfied.</p>

    <p>The old fir tree, whose high branches almost touched the
    roof, knew all about those shadows, but it was so old no one
    could ever understand a word of the many tales it told.</p>

    <p>"There's something scratching on the door," whispered
    Jessie; but it was only a mouse, who had sniffed the delightful
    odors of the Christmas goodies and was trying his best to find
    a way into the pantry and test them with his sharp teeth.</p>

    <p>"Come," said Jessie, "we'll turn to icicles if we stay here
    much, longer"; so up-stairs they quickly scampered.</p>

    <p>Papa had been to town on an errand, so it was quite late
    when he came home. As he was hunting in his pockets for his
    key, he heard a pitiful cry, and looking down he saw a big,
    white cat carrying a tiny kitten in her
    mouth.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>

    <p>"Poor thing," said papa, "you shall come inside till
    morning."</p>

    <p>Santa Claus had been there with the nicest wagon for Fred
    and a warm, seal-skin cap that lay right in the middle of it.
    When papa left the room, puss and her kitty were curled up
    comfortably on the rug singing their sleepy song.</p>

    <p>The sun was shining brightly in the dining-room window when
    Jessie and Fred made their appearance; then Fred just laughed
    with delight, for right in the crown of his new cap lay the
    cutest white kitten, with big, blue eyes and wee pink nose,
    while standins close by as if to guard her darling from danger,
    was good old mother puss.</p>

    <h2><a name="p51"
       id="p51">SUSY'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT.</a></h2>

    <p>"Tell us a story, nursie; please do", begged two little
    golden-haired girls, as they snuggled on the soft rug before
    the fire. "Did you ever have just what you wished for at
    Christmas, when you were a little girl?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I did once. I was the oldest, and had two brothers and
    three little sisters. We did not have a beautiful home like
    this. We lived in a little cottage. It was pretty, though, in
    the summer time, when the roses and pinks were in bloom. My
    father was dead, and mother worked for the rich people around
    the village. There was plenty to do about holiday times.</p>

    <p>"It was the day before Christmas. Mother was at the house of
    a very rich and kind lady. She was going to have a grand party
    in the evening.</p>

    <p>"Mother told me, when she went away, to mind the children,
    and perhaps I might have a nice Christmas present. I knew we
    should have plenty of candy and cake, and other nice things,
    from Mrs. Reid's. We often had pretty clothes, too, that Mamie
    and Robbie Reid had outgrown.</p>

    <p>"I had been wishing for a muff; but I knew Mother could not
    afford to buy me one. It was hard enough even to get shoes for
    us all. I thought I should have to be satisfied with
    mittens.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>

    <p>"It was quite dark, and we all sat around the fire. I had
    rocked Tilly to sleep and put her to bed. Willie and Joe were
    playing cat's-cradle. The rest of us were making believe we
    were rich and could have all we wanted for Christmas.</p>

    </div>

    <p>"All at once there was a heavy step on the porch, and a
    knock at the door. I opened it, with Margie and Amy clinging to
    my dress. A boy shoved a big box into the room and shouted, 'A
    merry Christmas to you!' He then ran out at the
    gate.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>

    <p>"The box had all our names on the cover, and the children

             alt="looking out the door" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"'Wait till mother comes,' I said; and pretty soon we heard
    her at the gate, She seemed surprised, and said Santa Claus had
    remembered us early.</p>

    <p>"Mother advised us to go to bed and wait until morning to
    see our presents. It was pretty hard; but we had some oranges
    and candy, and I put the boys to bed. Margie and I wondered and
    guessed what was in the box; but at last we fell asleep.</p>

    <p>"You may be sure we were up early in the morning. There were
    dolls and toys for the little ones, with hoods and mittens, and
    for me a lovely squirrel muff, lined with blue, with a soft
    little boa for my neck. I was a happy girl that Christmas, I
    can tell you.</p>

    <p>"And now, my dears, you must go to bed, or Santa Claus will
    not be able to find your stockings."</p>

    <p>"Oh! I hope I shall have what I want to-morrow!" said
    Gracie.</p>

    <p>"And I, too," echoed Helen. "And your story was very nice,
    nursie."</p>

    <p>Christmas was coming. Jamie and Ted had already begun to
    write long letters to Santa Claus. But one thing was rather
    queer: both boys asked him for the same things.</p>

    <p>Each little letter ended with,&mdash;"Just like

    <p>They agreed to ask for only one sled. They would rather ride
    together. Now was not this very sweet and loving?</p>

    <p>One night, after they had gone to bed, Jamie said, "Ted, if
    Santa Claus brings us skates, Jim can teach us how to use
    them."</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes; and if we get fur mittens it will be such fun to
    make a fort."</p>

    <p>"And a snow-man," Jamie answered.</p>

    <p>Ted went oh: "I'll always ride the sled down a hill, and you
    can ride it up."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"

    <p>"Because it'll be as much my sled as yours."</p>

    <p>"Yes, of course," Ted replied; "but I chose it first."</p>

    <p>"You are a selfish boy!" said Jamie.</p>

    <p>"Well, then, so are you!"</p>

    <p>"I don't care. I won't sleep with you. I'll ask mamma if I
    can't have the first pick; I'm the biggest," roared Jamie,
    bounding out of bed.</p>

    <p>"You're a big, cross cry baby," Ted shouted, jumping out
    after his brother.</p>

    <p>Away ran Jamie to mamma, with Ted at his heels. Both were
    angry. Both talked at once.</p>

    <p>Mamma was grieved. Her dear little boys had never been so
    unkind to each other before. She kissed their hot faces and
    stroked their pretty hair. She told them how their naughty
    words hurt her. She showed them how displeased God was to see
    two little brothers quarrel.</p>

    <p>That night they went to sleep in each other's arms, full of
    love and forgiveness.</p>

    <p>Christmas morning came at last. Very early the boys crept
    out of bed, just to "feel" their stockings.</p>

    <p>Papa heard them, and, remembering that he was once a boy
    lighted the gas.</p>

    <p>Each little red stocking was full from toe to top. Boxes and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> paper parcels were piled
       around them. Such shouting! Such a good time! It seemed as
       if all their letters had been answered.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Jamie cried, "O Ted, here's a letter!"</p>

    <p>They put their little heads together, and with papa's help
    spelled this out:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"My dear Boys,&mdash;No sled this year. It quarrelled so
        I was afraid to bring it. I dropped it off the load about a
        week ago. Get ready for it next year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Merry Christmas!

    <p>On Christmas day there is a great feast in Dublin. This, you

    children. There are in that city a great many little ones who
    are very <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"

       people there, also, who look after these poor children. They
       have what they call "ragged schools," where many of them are
       taught to read, and to sew, and other useful things.</p>

    <p>Dr. Nelaton is a famous minister in Dublin, and every year
    he, with other good people, gets up this great feast for the
    children. About eight hundred of them came last year. Some of
    these were only half-clad, and all were very ragged. They were
    seated at long, narrow tables, which were covered with a white
    cloth, The children from the ragged schools wore aprons in
    bright colors, to hide their rags. Each school had a color of
    its own. These aprons were only lent them for the day, and the
    children felt very fine in them. But there were two long rows
    without any aprons. These were little ones who had been picked
    up along the streets. Each ragged scholar had permission to
    bring all the children he could find. And, oh, how ragged and
    dirty these two rows were!</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:80%;">
        <a href="images/062.jpg"

             alt="feasting" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>But they brightened up, just like the children with aprons,
    when they saw the feast. A huge mug of steaming tea and an
    immense bun to each child! Rarely did they have such a treat as
    this. And how they did eat! Each child had all he wanted. It
    would have done you good to see their poor, pinched faces beam
    with delight. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> During the meal a large
       throng of orphan children in the gallery sung some sweet
       songs. Then, after the feast, there were small gifts, and
       little speeches and prayers, and more songs. The little
       ragged ones seemed like new beings in this atmosphere of
       love. Such a glad day as that Christmas was a rare event in
       their sad lives. Children who live in happy homes know
       little about the sufferings of the poor. Perhaps, if they
       knew more, such little ones would try harder, by gifts and
       kind acts, to carry sunshine to sorrowful hearts.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
